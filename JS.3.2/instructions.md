# Do While Loops
We are not going to spend a ton of time on do while loops cause almost always you can accomplish the same task with either a for loop or a while loop. Those are the two loops you are going to want to make sure you understand really well. With that being said it is still good to be exposed to the different options there are.

Basic syntax:

```javascript
do {
 //code will always run at least once in here.
} while(condition)
```
