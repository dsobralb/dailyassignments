# Links - External web pages
Part 1 - We can create links on our web page that will take us to other pages!! Go ahead and demonstrate how this is done on line 13. __Create a link to https://google.com.__ It is very important you have https:// on the link! If you do not it will look for a file called google.com which we don't have so it will fail.

Part 2 - We want to __create a link inside the paragraph tag that directs to gmail. Lets do this around the word 'link' inside the paragraph tag.__ The final product will display the word 'link' with an underline and will be the color blue. All the other words in the paragraph will still be black with no underline.


## Links - Relative files
Part 3 - Websites usually have more than just one page to display. Notice we have two html files in the top left - index.html and about.html. We can use links to route users to additional pages. Go ahead and create a link on line 20 that directs the user to the about.html page.

_Tip: The reason why we can link to a different html file is because the about.html is in the same folder as index.html. If about.html was in a different folder we would have to traverse our file system to link to it. ex. `./src/app/public/about.html` would be used if our about.html file was in a few layers deep of directories._

When you are done adding these links go ahead and run the tests then submit the assignment.
