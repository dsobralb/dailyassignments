 # Welcome
Welcome to the Javascript exercises! In these exercises there will be a number of problems for you to complete. You will type the code to solve these problems in the index.js file. When you want to see what your code is doing click the run button.

## A Word of Advice
As you go through these exercises you may not get the desired result your first try. You will need to learn how to debug your code and figure out where the code is failing and why. Your best friend is going to be --> `console.log()` This little bit of code is going to save you! You can put anything you want in the parenthesis and it will print it out to the console. This is super valuable for logging out variables that are not giving you the values that are expected. Take a look at the example in the editor to see how console.log and comments can be used.

## The problems
1. Let's start simple. Demonstrate the 3 different types of variables that can be used. _Hint: One of them is `let name = 2;`_ Make the name of the let variable `aLet` with any value. Make the name of the const variable `aConst` with any value. Make the name of the var variable `aVar` with any value
2. Assign the variable `aString` to any string. _When someone says to assign they mean to put a value after the equals sign._
3. Assign the variable `aNumber` to any number.
4. Assign the variable `aBool` to any boolean value. 
5. Add two numbers together. Assign `firstNumber`: 5 and `secondNumber`: 30. Add those two variables together and assign it to `addedNumbers`
6. Add two strings together. Assign `firstString` 'Hello ' and `secondString` 'World'. Add those two variables together and assign it to addedStrings
7. There is a variable that is set to true. Flip it to false using the not operator(!) and assign it to `lieDetector`
