# Functions
For this assignment most of the function for each problem will be written out for you. You will just need to implement some logic inside the function. The next assignment we will take off the training wheels and you will be writing your very own functions!

Something not working right? Make sure to use __console.log()__. You can call your functions like so: 
```javascript
functionName(parameter values go here separated by commas)
```
