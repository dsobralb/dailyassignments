# Rock, Paper, Scissors
Just like the heading says you are going to make a rock paper scissors game!

Steps:

1. Create a function called rockPaperScissors()
2. This function will take one parameter which will be a string.
3. The string will be either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.
4. Have the computer pick a random number between 1-3 or 0-2. (Unsure of how to do this? Check out this link https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp)
5. Based on that random number have the computers pick be either rock, paper, or scissors.
6. Determine who wins:
7. Rock beats scissors
8. Scissors beats paper
9. Paper beats rock
10. If the computer wins return the string 'You lose! I chose (computers choice goes here)'.
11. If the user wins return the string 'You win! I chose (computers choice goes here)'.
12. If the user and the computer choose the same thing return the string 'Its a tie! I chose (computers choice goes here)'
13. If the user enters anything other than rock paper or scissors return the string 'I do not understand. Try entering rock, paper, or scissors'.


No tests on this one. It will be your job to thoroughly test your program. I will then review it.
