# CSS Fonts
There is a page on canvas that is right before the current assignment you are on that talks all about fonts and text. Please refer to that page if you are confused on how to import fonts and how they work. (https://mtec.instructure.com/courses/605595/pages/additional-resources-css-fonts?module_item_id=11058895)

In this example we are going to implement our own font from google. They make it really easy for us. If you open up the html and css files you will see that we have implemented a font for you already.

Your task now is to go to fonts.google.com and import your own font to the myFont class.

Once you have done so run the tests and submit the assignment.
