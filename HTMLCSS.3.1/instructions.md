# The Box Model
The box model in CSS is extremely important for you to understand. Because of this we have examples to the left of what each attribute does. There is padding, border, and margin.

Padding is the first layer outside of the content. If you have a background-color and padding is applied the background color will fill that space. This is very useful for making good looking buttons and widening containers.

Borders are the layer applied after padding. They are exactly what you would expect them to be. The border of an element. This is the final part of the element you will actually be able to see.

Margins are used to create spacing between elements. This makes it so our elements are not all bunched together.

Go ahead and run the code and make sure you understand how the code is doing what it is doing. Change the values in the CSS! This is meant to be a playground for you to see whats going on. The actual assignments will start after this.

There are no tests attatched to this assignment. Instead go ahead and submit the assignment when you feel ready.
