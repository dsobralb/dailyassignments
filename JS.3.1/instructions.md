# While loops
Yesterday you learned all about for loops which are great for iterating over something that has a set length. While loops are super valuable when you want to loop through some code that you don't have a set amount of times it needs to run. For example if you created guess the number game(guess number between 1-100). If the user gets it wrong give them another chance. Keep giving them more chances till they finally guess that right number. Then finally exit the while loop. We don't know how many times we will need to keep asking to guess a number. So we would use a while loop to accomplish that.

Here is the basic syntax of a while loop:
```javascript
while(condition is true) {
 //do something
}
```
