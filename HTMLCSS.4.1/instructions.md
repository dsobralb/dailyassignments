# Containers
A very important concept that you are going to need to learn is how to use containers(like `<div></div>`). These containers allows you to do things like have a background color that covers a nav bar with nav items inside of it. Or a border around a form with form elements inside and position that form where you want it.

This assignment will give you some examples of how to implement containers(or parent elements). Then I give you some space to practice these concepts. This assignment does not have tests that you have to pass before you can submit this assignment. Instead I will be reviewing your submission to see if you followed along the instructions below.

## Example 1
Here is an example of a simple nav bar that you could make on a web page. Notice that we have a container that we use to center our text. We also use that container to have a background color and some padding to center the text vertically.

For the practice make your own nav bar. Change the different values of font-size, color, background-color and padding. Also for your nav bar space out the words more than how it is in the example.

## Example 2
Lets take a look at a situation when you may want to have multiple containers. What if you wanted to show multiple images and want words on those images? To the left we use background-color but it would work the same if we wanted to use a background-image. We have the boxes inside a container with a set width and center all the images using `margin: 0 auto;`

For the practice make your own boxes and center them with text on those boxes.

## Example 3
Here is an example you may want to know how to do when it comes to creating a background image with text on top when a user first lands on a web page. We have a container that holds our background-color(or image). Then we have another container that controls the positioning of the text.

Go ahead and try this out yourself in the 3rd practice. Feel free to change the different CSS attributes to see what everything does.

## Submission
Once done go ahead and submit the assignment and I will review your practices.
