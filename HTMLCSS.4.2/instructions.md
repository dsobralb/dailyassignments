# Floating Elements
In this assignment we have run into some problems. You are going to help us solve these problems using floats!

__First Problem:__ We have two divs. I would like them to be displayed on opposite sides of the page horizontally. Please fix this for me using the `#leftSide` and `#rightSide` CSS selectors! 

__Second Problem:__ Alright now that our containers are floated to opposite sides of the page we have created a problem. We have content in between our left and right content. I dont like this. Please fix this by selecting the parent element of our cards `#problem2`. Hint: It has to do with clear.

__Third Problem:__ I would really like our card content to display so they are all next to each other. Select the card class and float one direction.

__Fourth Problem:__ Looking good! One last thing. Let's center our cards on the page when the window is larger(You can see a larger window by dragging the middle bar to the left). Select the parent element to the cards `#cardsContainer` and make it `display: inline-block;` Then select the parent element of our cards container `#problem2` and use `text-align: center;` to center our cards. Why does this work? Making an element `display: inline-block;` makes it work like a span tag and we can center inline tags by using the text-align property.

__Submission:__ That is everything! Once you have followed the steps run the tests then submit.
