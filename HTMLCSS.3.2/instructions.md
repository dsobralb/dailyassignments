# CSS Box Model Practice
To the right we have 3 boxes. We are going to change the box model attributes in the CSS file.

1. Make it so the red box has 20px of padding on all sides using the short hand method.
2. Give the  yellow box 10px of padding on the top and bottom sides and 30px on the left and right sides. Use the short hand method where you only have to use two numbers.
3. Give the green box 20px of padding on top 10px to the right 5px on the bottom and 20px on the left using the short hand method.
4. Lets space out the elements. Select the parent class and give it a margin of 20px on the top and bottom and 0 on the left and right using the short hand method.
5. The yellow box could really use a border. Give it a solid 1px border that is black.

You will notice that our boxes are display: inline-block; This makes it so our div elements act like a span tag. Here is a fun trick to center an inline element. You select the parent element and give it a text-align: center; This will center our items on the page. Try it yourself!

After doing so run the tests and submit the assignment.
