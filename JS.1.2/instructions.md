# Problems
1. Subtract startDistance from endDistance and assign the result to distanceTraveled.
2. We need to figure out the area of my backyard to know exactly how much yard I have. The length of my yard is 15ft and the width of my yard is 100ft. Create variables for each and assign the result to a yardArea variable. Hint: Area is length times width.
3. I would like to figure out my resting heart rate. To be accurate I should take my resting heart rate multiple times and find the average to get a more accurate result. The first heart rate was 60BPM the second was 63BPM and the third was 59BPM. Assign each of these numbers to variables and assign the average heart rate using each of these variables to the averageHeartRate variable.
4. We have an order of operations error here. Add parenthesis so the result is 20.
5. Another order of operations error. The result should be 60.
