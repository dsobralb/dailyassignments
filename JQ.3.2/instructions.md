# jQuery .hover()
Another great handler to always remember is the hover function. In the code make it so anytime a user hovers over the #hover div the counter goes up by 1. When the user hovers away from the #hover element the counter should go up by one again.

## Important
To pass the tests you must grab the value in counter every time the user hovers. Change the value you receive and update the text.

There are scenarios where students will write perfectly working code but the tests do not pass. If this is the case for you, submit the code and I will grade the assignment based off of usability rather than if the tests pass.
