    <h1>My passion for thrifting</h1> 
    <p>Thrift stores typically sell items at much <span>lower prices</span> compared to buying new, making it a great option for people on a budget or looking to save money.</p>
    <p>Thrifting you can find high-quality, brand-name items for a <span>fraction</span> of the original price.</p>
    <p>Thrifting helps reduce waste by giving items a second life, preventing them from ending up in landfills. This promotes a more sustainable, circular economy.</p>
