# Problems
1. I need a fence around my yard now. Help me find the perimeter of my yard. Perimeter is width + width + length + length
2. With the yardPerimeter variable go ahead and use back ticks (``) with string interpolation (${}) to put the following message in the messagePerimeter variable --> 'You are going to need (insert perimeter here)ft of fence'. _Don't remember how to do this? Go back to the first repl.it assignment from today and look at the example problems console.log()._
3. One last thing. It is going to cost me $15 per foot of fence. What is the total price I am going to have to pay? Use the yardPerimeter variable and the pricePerFoot variable to find the total price and put that value in the totalPrice variable.
