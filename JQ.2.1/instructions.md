# Append
Being able to append elements to the DOM is a very powerful resource especially when dealing with lots of data. Lets first practice appending one element to our #appendToMe div.

In your javascript file go ahead and select the #appendToMe ID and append a paragraph tag that says 'Hello World' in it.

## New Tests
When you run the tests for the assignments going forward you will notice that the tests look different. If you see green dot(s) and `0 failures` this means that all the tests passed.
