# Intro
In this exercise there is going to be some code you have not learned before. If you don't recognize it thats okay! You will see __'functions'__ in the code. These are blocks of code that can be reused over and over again. We need these in this exercise for testing purposes. You will also notice that there are words inside the parenthesis right after the word function. This is a variable known as a parameter. We will go deeper into what parameters and functions are later on but for now know that the parameter(the word inside the parenthesis) is a variable I can change. 

To test your code you will need to use the function name with open an closed parenthesis. Inside the parenthesis put the value you would like to be stored in the parameter variable.

```javascript
problem1("The sun");
```

This will allow you to see what your code does. Notice we passed in the string "The sun". This will store that string into the parameter variable. We did this for you with the example problem. Click run and you can test it. Delete the line: example(); (NOT the line with function with example()) when you are done testing the example problem.

For each problem you will be given a statement that you need to recreate with code.

After reviewing the example problem and you are still confused please ask your instructor for help. It is important that you generally understand what is happening to continue.
