# Using .on()
In the videos you learned a lot of different event handlers. In the assignments we are going to focus on the most common handlers that you are going to be using.

Starting with using .on() select the #button element and when its clicked toggle the class 'darkMode' on the `body` element.

Notice how much easier it is to use the jQuery way instead of what we had to do before with plain javascript.
